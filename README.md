This repository only contains the executable binairies of the Boosted ReVOLT! Dashboard in `.hex` format. To update your Boosted ReVOLT! dashboard firmware, please refer to the [ReVOLT! Desktop Tool](https://github.com/MichaelCastiau/boosted-revolt-tool) that will update your dashboard automatically.

## Flashing Your Dashboard

To update your dashboard, you may manually flash the update to your dashboard.
You'll need: 
- An STLink debugger/programmer
- A Tag-connect 6 pin ARM adapter ([tag-connect.com](https://tag-connect.com))

Instead of a tag-connect wire, you may solder the wire connections needed. The board contains a 6-pin ARM connector
for programming.
